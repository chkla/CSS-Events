# List of Summer/ Winter Schools, Workshops and Conferences in Computational Social Science

Computational Social Science is a fast growing field üöÄ that brings multiple disciplines together. Summer and winter schools are a great place to find like-minded people, exchange ideas, learning new things from experts and have a great time together (and make new friends). This community-driven repository attempts to list all upcomming events so that everyone has the chance to attend.

But it needs the help of the CSS community: Please send me a message (üìß [mail](mailto:christopher.klamm@hotmail.de) or üê• [twitter](https://twitter.com/chklamm)) or open pull requests ‚¨ÜÔ∏è for any summer and winter schools you come across! Thank you very much for your support ‚ù§Ô∏è
