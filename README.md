# List of Summer/ Winter Schools, Workshops and Conferences in Computational Social Science

Computational Social Science is a fast growing field 🚀 that brings multiple disciplines together. Summer and winter schools are a great place to find like-minded people, exchange ideas, learning new things from experts and have a great time together (and make new friends). This community-driven repository attempts to list all upcomming events so that everyone has the chance to attend.

But it needs the help of the CSS community: Please send me a message (📧 [mail](mailto:christopher.klamm@hotmail.de) or 🐥 [twitter](https://twitter.com/chklamm)) or open pull requests ⬆️ for any summer and winter schools you come across! Thank you very much for your support ❤️
